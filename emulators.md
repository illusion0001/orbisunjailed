## What are emulators and what systems can I play on PS4?

* Emulators are applications that act/behave like a completely different system in order to play games released before / not natively made for PS4.
* On the PS4, there are 2 types of emulators: official (either made by Sony or the company that made/owns the rights to the emulated console) and ports (fan-made emulators).
* Officially the PS4 can emulate PS1, PS2, PSP (but the number of PSP games that work are very low) & Sega Saturn.
* Ports allow the PS4 to emulate MSDOS, NES, every GameBoy, MAME, Atari Lynx, Neo-Geo Pocket, SNES, VirtualBoy, WonderSwan, Nintendo 64, PS1, Sega Genesis/MegaDrive, Nintendo DS, FB Alpha Arcades, Capcom PS1,2 &3, MSX, NEC PC-FX, NEC PC Engine, Sega Saturn, Sega Dreamcast, old PC games, Atari 2600, Atari Jaguar, Vectrex, PSP, various ports, 3DO.

## Enough talk, let's start...

* Before attempting, check compatibility list here (if a game is not on the list, feel free to test it):
<a href="https://www.psdevwiki.com/ps4/PS1_Classics_Emulator_Compatibility_List"> PS1 Compatibility List </a>
* Download and extract PSX-FPKG:

* You might've noticed that the wiki has mentions for fixes or using different emus for PS2-FPKG.
* Fixes are found here:
   * <a href="https://www.psx-place.com/threads/research-ps2-emulator-configuration-on-ps4.16131/page-147"> PS2 Config Files </a>
   * Use search bar (must be signed-in), search for your game and make sure you check "In this thread only".
   * You will find mentions of what emulator to use, and CLI + LUA fixes.
   * CLI are .txt files and LUA are .lua files. Both can be done with any notepad editor (make sure you lua files aren't .lua.txt!)
* Emus can be found here:
   * <a href="https://github.com/florinsdistortedvision/ps2-classics-emus"> PS2 Classics Emus </a>
   * Simply unarchive the files and put the emus folder in PS2-FPKG directory. Once you open the program, you will have a drop down list in emulator section.

#### PSP

* Note that even though it is made by Sony, there are only a few games that can be played. Use RetroArch for better compatibility and speed.

### Emulator Ports

* For the majority of the systems, RetroArch is the recommended option.
* Note that RetroArch has been unofficially ported, thus not all cores from PC version might be available.
* Games can be loaded via a USB drive formatted as exFAT. The roms can be placed in a folder.
* RetroArch and it's Core Installer can be found here: <a href="https://www.psx-place.com/threads/retroarch-ps4-r4-released-21-new-cores-added-ppsspp-mame-2015-new-dynarec-support-flycast.30137/"> RetroArch </a>
* Alternatively, it can also be found via the 
[Homebrew Store](hb-store.md)
* Order of installation: Retroarch Core Installer > Ok to install every core and then RetroArch.
* Done.

## Troubleshooting

 * I built a pkg file with its tool but game either crashes or black screens. In this case the game is not supported.
